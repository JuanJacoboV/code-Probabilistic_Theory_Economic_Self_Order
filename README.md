# code-Probabilistic_Theory_Economic_Self_Order

This code reproduces the results in Section 4 of A Probabilistic Theory of Economic Self-Order. To avoid problems, make sure that Quarto supports Julia code. See https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html for instructions. 

If you are new to Julia, you will need to add the packages used in each qmd file. 

The contraction mapping algorithm in s_approx.jl was obtained from https://github.com/QuantEcon/book-dp1-public/tree/main/code/jl.
